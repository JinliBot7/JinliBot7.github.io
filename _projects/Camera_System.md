In this project, we developed a multimodal perception system that is composed of a RGB-D camera and a thermal camera. Customized calibration tools and algorithms are designed to obtain the extrinsic matrix of the thermal camera with respect to the depth camera frame. By optimizing the projection calculation, the system outputs RGB-D-T point cloud at 5 Hz.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
``` -->
