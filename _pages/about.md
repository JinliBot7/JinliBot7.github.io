I am a M.Phil. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at <a style="color:black; font-style: bold;" href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>, supervised by Professor <a style="color:black; font-style: bold;" href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/david-navarro-alarcon-dr/">David NAVARRO-ALARCON </a>. Since 2019, I have been working in <a style="color:lighskyblue; font-style: bold;" href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/david-navarro-alarcon-dr/"> Robotics and Machine Intelligence Laboratory (Romi Lab)</a> on sensor-based robot motion control. Before that, I obtained Bachelor's degree at the same university and department.</span>

My current research lies in the intersection of multimodal robot perception and servomechanisms. During my graduate study, I have been exploring a new type of control problem  <span style="color:red; font-style: bold;">"thermal servoing"</span>, which aims to regulate the temperature of objects in dynamic heat transfer systems by means of active robot motion. Through this academic expedition, I have learned and practiced research skills in non-linear system control, thermodynamics, multiple view geometry, image processing, and optical simulation.
